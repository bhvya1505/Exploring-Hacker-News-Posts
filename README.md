# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts
This project involves use of beginner-level python skills to analyze two different kinds of posts on Hacker-News. We are specifically interested in Ask HN and Show HN posts.

The original dataset is **HN_posts_year_to_Sep_26_2016.csv**. However, a simpler data set with only posts with comments has been considered for this project - **hacker_news.csv**.

Refer the Jupyter Notebook file **Basics.ipynb** for more details and explaination about the project.
